## How To Play
 - It is based on the traditional rock paper scissors game. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has 
 chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), 
 - but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
 a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). 
 - If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. 


## Objective
- The goal is to create an interactive user site experience using a command line interface.
